# PortfolioPiece1LivestockApp

This repositor contains a demonstration of the forcast page from Task 4 of COMP609 Application Development.
The requirements of this task were to develop an application using C# and .NET MAUI and implementing a SQLite database.

The purpose of this livestock management application is to provide farmers with tools to efficiently monitor and track, 
livestock and the produce such as wool and milk.

This is the GUI of the Forcast page. It allows the user to add generic or custom livestock to a virtual collection, and 
providing dynamic calculations for the totals of Cost, Produce, Tax, Income and Profit.
